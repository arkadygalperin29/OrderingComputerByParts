A very simple example of the pc-constructor(ordering pc the same way as if it was a pizza) when using Koin. User has a possibility to enter customer's data in order to be called later on when the order is ready and to construct the PC he/she wants including such attributes as:
Monitor
Graphics Card
Operation System
including Checkbox with add-ons e.g. mouse/keyboard/webcam
Then confirm button allows to send the completed order as a text via any messenger user has on device.
